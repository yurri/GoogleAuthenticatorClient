Implements an interface to access Google Authenticator functionality

Supports both counter-based (HOTP) and time-based (TOTP) authentication mechanisms

Is loosely based on other publicly available implementations:
    1)  https://github.com/PHPGangsta/GoogleAuthenticator by Michael Kliewe
    2)  http://dendory.net/twofactors by Patrick Lambert

This class uses base32 encoding and decoding by Bryan Ruiz

Usage:

    1)  When user is registered or enrolled into 2 factor authentication, generate a unique key for them with getNewKey()
        That key should be stored as it will be used every time user attempts to authenticate

    2)  Call getQrCodeUrl() to show them a QR code to set up their authenticator app
        If the QR code cannot be used or is not desired, ask user to enter the generated key into their app manually
        It is possible to set up two kind of accounts in the app - counter- and time-based

    3)  Once user's app is initialised, ask for that value when user needs to be authenticated and call
        verifyCode() supplying the value provided.
        The client must be set into a proper mode - counter or time-based (depending on what QR code user has been given)
